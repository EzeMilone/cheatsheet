# cheatsheet
This is a simple project proposed by Codecademy's 'Full-Stack Engineer' course to practice the knowledge of the course so far.

The idea was to summarise a topic of HTML or CSS to practise. In my case I decided to follow the course example and showed the concepts of tables in HTML just because I
thought it was one of the topics that I needed to practise more to understand.
